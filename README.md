# Lighthalzen
Now on developing.  
To see image preview, take a look at [this link](https://cite.app.yuoa.pm/).

## Lighthalzen uses Sass
Refer to [Sass homepage](https://sass-lang.com) for more information.

### How to change `.scss` files to `style.css`
In `lighthalzen` directory, you can type `sass --sourcemap=none --watch scss/ltz.scss:style.css` to continuously build whole scss files into `style.css`.

### Caution
#### Server Access Configuration
For mental peace, check your web server configuration to hide `.scss` and `.md` files.  
I also recommend you to check hiding of `.sass-cache` and `.git` directory.
